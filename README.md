# csv2svg_graph
Convert csv to SVG graphs - the easy way!

# Features
* Reads a CSV file and turns it into a line graph
* Uses [pygal](http://pygal.org/)
* Uses lines starting with `#` as a title
* Automatically maps CSV headers to the legend
* Blank lines are automatically skipped

# Missing features
This is a very quick and dirty CSV to SVG converter which I wrote because I 
couldn't for the life of me find a good python tool do to this already.

This tool is pretty basic at the moment and is missing things like better
error handling, X-axis labels, different graph types, etc.

If your interested in helping developing this tool, drop me a line!

$ csv2svg_graph.py --input_file /path/to/csv_file --output_file output_file.svg
